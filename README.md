## Install

If you want to install this you can compile it

## @LaughingQuoll has to fix:

- The notifications, especially on iPad. They're not centered, they're transparent instead of blurry (unless used with Noctis... LQ, adding a new blur view on Noctis is probably why it is laggy, lol)
- Safe Mode issues, which have to do with notifications as well. i.e when I open NC with a notification there, close it, and open it again without clearing notifications will result in Safe Mode
- My ugly code?
